# Statisical Inference

Simulation exercise 1 will compare the exponential distribution in R to the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). Given lambda = 0.2 for all of the simulations the goal is to investigate the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials over a thousand simulations.

Simulation exercise 2 uses data that is going to be analyzed as the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package. Project objectives include:

1. Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analyses
2. Provide a basic summary of the data.
3. Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose. (Only use the techniques from class, even if there's other approaches worth considering)
4. State your conclusions and the assumptions needed for your conclusions.
